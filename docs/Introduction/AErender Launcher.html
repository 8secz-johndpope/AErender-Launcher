		<h1>Introduction to AErender Launcher</h1>
		<p><b>AErender Launcher</b> is a free and open source software that is made to replace default <i>aerender</i> console interface with modern and simple GUI. It also has additional features and capable of speeding up any Adobe After Effects render up to 4x times (but keep in mind that it depends on available CPU cores and RAM). By default, Adobe After Effects render can utilize only 20-30% of any multi-core CPU. <b>Launcher</b> solves this problem by starting not one but several renders at the same time. As the result, CPU utilization goes up to 100% and your render will be finished faster.</p>
		<p><b>Launcher</b> is available both Windows and macOS. Also, it's fully <b>After Effects version independent</b> and prooved to work even with After Effects CS4. Though, we won't provide you any support, if your After Effects version lower than CC 2014.</p>
		<p>If you encounter any bugs - please, report them at out GitHub page which could be found here: <a href="https://github.com/LilyStilson/AErender-Launcher" target="_blank">github.aerenderlauncher.com</a></p>
		<p>We also have a website, if you're not very familiar with GitHub. It's pretty simple, but responsive: <a href="http://aerenderlauncher.com" target="_blank">aerenderlaucher.com</a></p>
